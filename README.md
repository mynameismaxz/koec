# KOEC, KOng Error Customization

## Description

KOEC (Kong Error Customization) is a Go-based module designed to streamline the process of customizing error pages within the Kong API Gateway. This lightweight, efficient tool provides developers with a flexible way to create, manage, and display tailored error responses, ensuring smooth integration with Kongâ€™s infrastructure. Built with simplicity in mind, KOEC enhances user experience by allowing structured, consistent error handling across services.

## How to use KOEC

KOEC is designed to be included in a Kong Gateway container as a binary. To use it, you need to build the KOEC application and incorporate it into Kong's Docker container. Below is an example of how to modify Kong's `Dockerfile` to include KOEC.

```Dockerfile
# Build the KOEC binary
FROM golang:1.22.0 as plugin-builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o koec main.go

# Add KOEC to the Kong container
FROM kong:3.7.1
USER root
COPY --from=plugin-builder /app/koec /usr/local/bin/koec
...
```

Once the image with KOEC is built, you can configure Kong to use the KOEC plugin. Follow the configuration steps outlined in the [Kong documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/pluginserver/go/#example-configuration). An example configuration is provided below:

```yaml
pluginserver_names = koec

pluginserver_koec_socket = /usr/local/kong/koec.socket
pluginserver_koec_start_cmd = /usr/local/bin/koec
pluginserver_koec_query_cmd = /usr/local/bin/koec -dump
```
